# Hello-Test
Creating this one by starting at Github.com
Author: John Wells
Goal of this project is to try several different methods of creating a simple Java project and adding to Github.

In this method, I'm starting everything from github.com.
I have created a repository using github.com, with a default readme file.
Then I created a branch called readme-edits, in which I am entering these changes.

Next I will commit.
